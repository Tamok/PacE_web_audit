  This repository contains PacE AID, an internal auditing tool for UCSB PaCE.
  It crawls three PaCE web domains, indexes all pages and audits them for layout
  consistency, language, branding (colors, pictures, logo), ADA compliance and
  other UCSB PaCE policies. Approved brand colors and logos come from the
  spreadsheet at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSzhsMRhe-VVLFfa89R9aUNJ58dIvGCMF41QWiOig4wqZHMJJ4_xDVql11siefnc3stU17WyFqbUeLb/pubhtml
  and are listed in ``pace_aid/brand.py``. The code should remain modular,
  transparent and professionally documented. Use safe, reliable libraries and
  keep the testing pipeline green. Output JSON and an HTML dashboard summarizing
  audit results.
